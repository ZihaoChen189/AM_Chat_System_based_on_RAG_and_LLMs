Based on the retrieved documents, the brittleness of polylactic acid (PLA) can be improved through several strategies, primarily focusing on enhancing its flexibility and impact resistance:

### Key Approaches to Reduce PLA Brittleness:
1. **Plasticization**  
   - Adding low-molecular-weight **plasticizers** (e.g., lactides, oligomeric lactic acid, citrate esters, polyethylene glycol) lowers the glass transition temperature ((T_g)), increasing chain mobility and ductility ([reference_156.pdf, page 1051](file:///Users/robert/Desktop/project/documents/reference_156.pdf)).  

2. **Copolymerization**  
   - Incorporating flexible comonomers (e.g., caprolactone, ethylene oxide) disrupts PLA’s rigid chain structure, improving elongation-at-break and impact resistance ([reference_156.pdf, page 1051](file:///Users/robert/Desktop/project/documents/reference_156.pdf)).  

3. **Blending with Flexible Polymers/Rubbers**  
   - Melt blending PLA with **toughening agents** such as:  
     - Biodegradable polyesters (e.g., poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), polycaprolactone (PCL)).  
     - Elastomers (e.g., natural rubber, acrylic rubber).  
   - These form a dispersed rubbery phase that absorbs impact energy and arrests crack propagation ([reference_156.pdf, page 1051](file:///Users/robert/Desktop/project/documents/reference_156.pdf); [reference_30.pdf, page 369](file:///Users/robert/Desktop/project/documents/reference_30.pdf)).  

4. **Reactive Blending**  
   - Using **reactive compatibilizers** (e.g., peroxides, multifunctional epoxies) during melt blending promotes *in-situ* copolymer formation. This enhances interfacial adhesion between PLA and toughening phases, significantly improving impact strength (e.g., achieving >500% increase in notched Izod impact) ([reference_156.pdf, page 1051](file:///Users/robert/Desktop/project/documents/reference_156.pdf)).  

### Additional Notes:
- **Stereochemistry/Molecular Weight**: Adjusting L/D-lactide ratios or increasing molecular weight offers marginal improvements but is insufficient alone for high-toughness applications.  
- **Crystallinity Control**: Annealing can increase crystallinity but may exacerbate brittleness; plasticizers/copolymerization counterbalance this effect.
