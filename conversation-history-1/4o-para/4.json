      "assistant_response": "The appropriate nozzle temperature for 3D printing using fused deposition modeling with polylactic acid (PLA) mixed with microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) is up to 230°C. However, it is noted that at this temperature, some low-molecular fractions of the MCC may start degrading. In the specific study referenced, the temperature for the 3D printing was set at 200°C [reference_121.pdf].",
