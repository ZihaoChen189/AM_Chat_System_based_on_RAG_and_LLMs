      "assistant_response": "The documents do not provide specific information about the appropriate nozzle temperature for 3D printing using fused deposition modeling with polylactic acid (PLA) mixed with Hydroxyapatite (HA). However, for pure PLA, the printing temperature range is generally between 190–230°C, with an optimal temperature found to be around 215°C for the best properties. It is likely that similar temperatures could be applicable for PLA/HA composites, but specific adjustments may be necessary depending on the HA content and other factors. For precise settings, further experimentation or additional sources would be needed.",
