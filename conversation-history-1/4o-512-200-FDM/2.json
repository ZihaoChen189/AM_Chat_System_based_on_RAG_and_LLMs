      "assistant_response": "The retrieved documents do not provide specific information about the appropriate nozzle temperature for 3D printing using fused deposition modeling with polylactic acid (PLA) mixed with wood particles. However, for pure PLA, the printing temperature range is generally between 190–230 °C, with an optimum temperature found to be 215 °C for the best properties [reference_188.pdf, page 784]. You may need to experiment within this range to find the optimal temperature for PLA mixed with wood particles.",
