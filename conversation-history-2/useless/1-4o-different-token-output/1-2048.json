      "assistant_response": "In polylactic acid (PLA) composites, fillers are commonly used to reduce costs or modify the properties of the polymeric compounds. The types of fillers used include:\n\n1. **Carbon-based fillers**: These include continuous carbon fiber (CCF), short carbon fiber (SCF), carbon fiber (CF), continuous flax fiber (cFF), and carbon nanotube (CNT). Carbon-based fillers are widely used, with a high percentage of researchers incorporating them into PLA composites for their potential to significantly enhance mechanical properties [reference_188.pdf, page 779].\n\n2. **Plant-based fillers**: Examples include wood particles, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hemp hurd, hemp fibers, carbonized cellulose nanofibers, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), cellulose nanofibers (CNF), cellulose nanocrystal (CNC), and cork powder. These fillers are used to improve mechanical properties and are valued for being natural and bio-based [reference_188.pdf, page 779].\n\n3. **Mineral-based fillers**: These include hydroxyapatite, akermanite, and ceramics. Mineral fillers are used to enhance properties like stiffness and heat resistance [reference_188.pdf, page 779].\n\nAdditionally, talc is a specific microfiller that is frequently mixed with PLA. It can speed up PLA crystallization, increase stiffness and heat resistance, improve dimensional stability and barrier properties, and reduce molding time and production costs [reference_29.pdf, page 27].\n\nThe use of these fillers can lead to improved mechanical parameters, such as increased modulus/stiffness at room or elevated temperatures, especially in PLA grades that allow a high degree of crystallinity [reference_29.pdf, page 27].",
