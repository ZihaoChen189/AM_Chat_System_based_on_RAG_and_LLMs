      "assistant_response": "In polylactic acid (PLA) composites, fillers are used to reduce costs or modify the properties of the polymer, such as optical, physical, and rheological characteristics. The common types of fillers used in PLA composites include:\n\n1. **Plant-based Fillers**: These include wood particles, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hemp hurd, hemp fibers, carbonized cellulose nanofibers, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), cellulose nanofibers (CNF), cellulose nanocrystal (CNC), and cork powder. Plant-based fillers are noted for their renewable nature and can enhance the biodegradability of the composites.\n\n2. **Carbon-based Fillers**: These consist of continuous carbon fiber (CCF), short carbon fiber (SCF), carbon fiber (CF), continuous flax fiber (cFF), and carbon nanotube (CNT). Carbon-based fillers are often used for their ability to significantly improve mechanical properties such as stiffness and strength.\n\n3. **Mineral-based Fillers**: This category includes materials like hydroxyapatite, akermanite, and ceramics. Mineral-based fillers can enhance properties such as heat resistance, stiffness, and dimensional stability.\n\nThe choice of filler depends on the desired properties of the final composite material, and each type of filler brings its own set of characteristics to the PLA composite, such as increased modulus/stiffness, improved heat resistance, and enhanced crystallization behavior [reference_188.pdf; reference_29.pdf].",
