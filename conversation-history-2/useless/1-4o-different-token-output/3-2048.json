      "user_message": "What types of fillers are commonly used in polylactic acid (PLA) composites, and what are their characteristics?",
      "assistant_response": "Polylactic acid (PLA) composites commonly use various types of fillers, which can be categorized into microfillers and nanofillers. The main types of fillers and their characteristics are as follows:\n\n1. **Microfillers**: These include talc, carbonaceous fillers, hydroxyapatite, inorganic carbonates and sulfates, mica, and kaolin. Microfillers are used to reduce costs and modify properties such as stiffness and heat resistance. For example, talc is known to speed up PLA crystallization, increase stiffness and heat resistance, improve dimensional stability and barrier properties, and reduce molding time and production costs.\n\n2. **Nanofillers**: These include organo-modified layered silicates (OMLS), graphite derivatives, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), sepiolite, halloysite, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS), silica, and ZnO nanoparticles. Although PLA nanocomposites with these fillers have been explored in recent research, the focus has shifted more towards PLA composites with microfillers in some studies.\n\nAdditionally, PLA composites can be reinforced with various other fillers for specific applications, such as:\n\n- **Carbon-based fillers**: Including continuous carbon fiber, short carbon fiber, and carbon nanotubes. These fillers are widely used, with a high percentage of research focusing on them.\n\n- **Plant-based fillers**: Such as wood particles, cellulose fibers, and cork powder. These fillers are notable for their abundance as natural bio-based materials.\n\n- **Mineral-based fillers**: Including hydroxyapatite, akermanite, and ceramics.\n\nThese fillers are incorporated into PLA to improve mechanical properties such as the elastic modulus and stiffness, especially in PLA grades that allow high levels of crystallinity, while also being cost-effective [reference_188.pdf, page 779; reference_29.pdf, pages 17, 27].",
