      "assistant_response": "In polylactic acid (PLA) composites, fillers are commonly used to reduce costs or modify the properties of the polymer. The types of fillers typically used in PLA composites include:\n\n1. **Plant-Based Fillers**: These include wood particles, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hemp hurd, hemp fibers, carbonized cellulose nanofibers, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), cellulose nanofibers (CNF), cellulose nanocrystal (CNC), and cork powder. Plant-based fillers are used to improve mechanical properties and are environmentally friendly.\n\n2. **Carbon-Based Fillers**: This category includes continuous carbon fiber (CCF), short carbon fiber (SCF), carbon fiber (CF), continuous flax fiber (cFF), and carbon nanotubes (CNT). Carbon-based fillers are known for providing high strength and stiffness to the composites.\n\n3. **Mineral-Based Fillers**: Examples include hydroxyapatite, akermanite, and ceramics. Mineral-based fillers can enhance the thermal and mechanical properties of PLA composites.\n\nFillers are generally used to enhance the mechanical properties, such as the elastic modulus and stiffness, at room or elevated temperatures, especially in PLA grades that allow a high degree of crystallinity. They can also improve dimensional stability, heat resistance, and barrier properties, as observed with fillers like talc, which is particularly effective in improving PLA's performance [reference_188.pdf, reference_29.pdf].",
