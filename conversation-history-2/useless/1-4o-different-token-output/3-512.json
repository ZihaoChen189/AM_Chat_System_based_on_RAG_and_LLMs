      "assistant_response": "Common types of fillers used in polylactic acid (PLA) composites include plant-based, carbon-based, and mineral-based fillers. Each type of filler has distinct characteristics:\n\n1. **Plant-based Fillers**: These include wood particles, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hemp hurd, hemp fibers, carbonized cellulose nanofibers, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), cellulose nanofibers (CNF), cellulose nanocrystal (CNC), and cork powder. Plant-based fillers are often used to enhance the mechanical properties of PLA while maintaining its biodegradability.\n\n2. **Carbon-based Fillers**: These consist of continuous carbon fiber (CCF), short carbon fiber (SCF), carbon fiber (CF), continuous flax fiber (cFF), and carbon nanotubes (CNT). Carbon-based fillers are known for their ability to significantly improve the mechanical strength and stiffness of PLA composites.\n\n3. **Mineral-based Fillers**: This category includes fillers such as hydroxyapatite, akermanite, and ceramics. Mineral-based fillers can improve the thermal and mechanical properties of PLA composites and are often used in applications requiring enhanced heat resistance and stability.\n\nFillers are generally mixed with polymers like PLA to reduce costs and modify properties such as the optical, physical, and rheological characteristics of the polymeric compounds. They can enhance mechanical properties like the elastic modulus and stiffness at room or high temperatures, especially in PLA grades that allow high levels of crystallinity (reference_188.pdf, reference_29.pdf).",
