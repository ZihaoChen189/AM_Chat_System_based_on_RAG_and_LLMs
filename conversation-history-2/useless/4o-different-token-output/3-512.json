      "user_message": "What is Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) technology and how is it related to polylactic acid (PLA)?",
      "assistant_response": "Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) is an additive manufacturing technique that is widely used due to its versatility and low cost. It involves the selective dispensing of a thermoplastic polymer through a nozzle to create three-dimensional objects. This process is prevalent in industries like automotive and aeronautics, although it is not completely industrialized due to the lack of standardization and the large number of parameters that govern the process (reference_184.pdf).\n\nPolylactic acid (PLA) is a biocompatible thermoplastic polymer commonly used in FDM technology. PLA is derived from renewable sources such as starch and is considered eco-friendly because it degrades into water and carbon dioxide, which are not hazardous to the environment. It is a popular choice for FDM due to its low melting point, non-toxic nature, and good printability compared to other plastics (reference_189.pdf, reference_188.pdf, reference_184.pdf).\n\nWhile PLA has limitations such as poor mechanical properties, these can be enhanced through filler reinforcement and optimization of processing parameters in FDM, thereby producing higher-quality printed parts (reference_188.pdf).",
