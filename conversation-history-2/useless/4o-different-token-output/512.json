      "user_message": "What is Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) technology and how is it related to polylactic acid (PLA)?",
      "assistant_response": "Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) is an additive manufacturing (AM) technique that selectively dispenses a thermoplastic polymer through a nozzle to build parts layer by layer. It is widely used due to its versatility, low cost, and ability to produce neat and intricate parts. FDM technology is particularly prevalent in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and biomedicals (reference_189.pdf, page 2877; reference_184.pdf, page 2).\n\nPolylactic acid (PLA) is a biocompatible thermoplastic that is extensively used in FDM technology. It is chosen for its eco-friendly properties, as it degrades into water and carbon dioxide, which are not hazardous to the environment. PLA is derived from renewable sources like starch and is more printable with mechanical properties significantly higher than most other plastics, except some kinds of polycarbonate, nylon, and composite blends (reference_188.pdf, page 775; reference_184.pdf, page 2). However, PLA has limitations in terms of mechanical properties, and filler reinforcement is often used to enhance the quality of FDM-printed parts (reference_188.pdf, page 775).",
