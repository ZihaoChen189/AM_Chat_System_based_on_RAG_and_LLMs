      "user_message": "What is Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) technology and how is it related to polylactic acid (PLA)?",
      "assistant_response": "Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) is an additive manufacturing (AM) technique known for its versatility and low cost, making it prevalent in industries like automotive and aeronautics. It involves selectively dispensing a thermoplastic polymer through a nozzle to create parts. Despite its popularity, FDM is not completely industrialized due to the numerous parameters that govern the process and the lack of standardization and studies [reference_184.pdf, page 2].\n\nPolylactic acid (PLA) is a thermoplastic polymer commonly used in FDM due to its eco-friendly properties. PLA is derived from renewable sources like starch and is biodegradable, breaking down into water and carbon dioxide, which are not hazardous to the environment. This makes PLA a more sustainable alternative compared to fossil-based polymers. PLA is also known for its biocompatibility and has better mechanical properties than many other plastics used in FDM [reference_188.pdf, page 775; reference_184.pdf, page 2].\n\nFDM technology frequently utilizes PLA because of these advantages, despite PLA having limitations such as poor mechanical properties, which can be enhanced through filler reinforcement [reference_188.pdf, page 775].",
