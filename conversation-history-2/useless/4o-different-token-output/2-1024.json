      "user_message": "What is Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) technology and how is it related to polylactic acid (PLA)?",
      "assistant_response": "Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) is an additive manufacturing (AM) technique that is widely used due to its versatility and low cost. It involves selectively dispensing a thermoplastic polymer through a nozzle to create parts layer by layer. FDM is prevalent in industries such as automotive and aeronautics and is known for producing neat and intricate parts.\n\nPolylactic acid (PLA) is one of the most commonly used materials in FDM technology. It is a biocompatible thermoplastic derived from renewable sources like starch and is preferred for its eco-friendly properties. PLA is a more printable material with mechanical properties higher than most other plastics, making it suitable for FDM applications. However, it has limitations in mechanical strength, which can be enhanced through filler reinforcement. The processing parameters for FDM play a significant role in determining the quality of the printed PLA parts (reference_188.pdf; reference_189.pdf; reference_184.pdf).",
