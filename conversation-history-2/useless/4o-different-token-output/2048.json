      "user_message": "What is Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) technology and how is it related to polylactic acid (PLA)?",
      "assistant_response": "Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) is a popular additive manufacturing technique known for its versatility and low cost. It involves selectively dispensing a thermoplastic polymer through a nozzle to build parts layer by layer. FDM is widely used in various industries, including automotive and aeronautics, due to its ability to produce intricate and functional parts.\n\nPolylactic acid (PLA) is a biocompatible thermoplastic that is commonly used in FDM technology. It is an aliphatic polyester material derived from renewable sources like starch. PLA is appreciated for its eco-friendly properties, as it degrades into water and carbon dioxide, which are not hazardous to the environment. Despite its popularity, PLA has limitations in terms of mechanical properties, which can be improved through filler reinforcement and optimal processing parameters. PLA's properties and the processing parameters play a significant role in determining the quality of the FDM-printed parts [reference_189.pdf; reference_188.pdf; reference_184.pdf].",
