      "user_message": "What is Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) technology and how is it related to polylactic acid (PLA)?",
      "assistant_response": "Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) is an additive manufacturing technique that has become one of the most prevalent approaches for producing functional parts. It is known for its versatility, low cost, and ability to produce neat and intricate parts. FDM technology involves selectively dispensing a thermoplastic polymer through a nozzle to create a 3D object layer by layer.\n\nPolylactic acid (PLA) is one of the most commonly used materials in FDM technology. PLA is an aliphatic polyester that is biocompatible and eco-friendly, breaking down into water and carbon dioxide when it degrades, which are not hazardous to the environment. It is derived from renewable sources such as starch and is known for its good mechanical properties compared to other plastics like acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). However, PLA has limitations in terms of mechanical strength, which can be addressed by filler reinforcement to enhance the quality of FDM-printed parts. The processing parameters in FDM also play a significant role in determining the quality of the printed product [reference_189.pdf; reference_188.pdf; reference_184.pdf].",
