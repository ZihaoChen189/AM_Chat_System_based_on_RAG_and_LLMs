      "assistant_response": "The documents do not provide specific information on the appropriate nozzle temperature for 3D printing using fused deposition modeling with polylactic acid (PLA) mixed with Hydroxyapatite (HA). However, for pure PLA, the printing temperature is typically in the range of 190–230°C, with an optimal temperature around 215°C for the best properties [reference_188.pdf, page 784]. It is likely that the presence of HA might affect the optimal temperature, but specific data for the PLA/HA composite is not provided.",

However, one document discusses the effect of layer height on surface roughness for PLA in general, indicating that smaller layer heights result in smoother surfaces, with a range from 0.05 mm to 0.25 mm being tested [reference_145.pdf, page 1]. This information might be applicable to PLA/HA composites, but specific data for the composite is not provided.",
