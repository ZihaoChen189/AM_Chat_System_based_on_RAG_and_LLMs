      "assistant_response": "The retrieved documents do not provide specific information about the appropriate nozzle temperature for 3D printing using fused deposition modeling with polylactic acid (PLA) mixed with cellulose nanocrystal (CNC). However, for pure PLA, the printing temperature range is generally between 190–230°C, with an optimal temperature found to be around 215°C for pure PLA prints. It is important to consider that the addition of cellulose nanocrystals might affect the optimal printing temperature, but specific details are not provided in the documents.",
