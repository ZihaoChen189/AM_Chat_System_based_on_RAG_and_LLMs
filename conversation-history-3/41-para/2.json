      "assistant_response": "Based on the retrieved documents, nozzle diameters of 0.2 mm and 0.4 mm are commonly used for 3D printing with polylactic acid (PLA) using fused deposition modeling (FDM). For example, one study used nozzle diameters of 0.2 mm and 0.4 mm to print PLA specimens and investigated their effects on pore size and porosity. Another study specifies a 0.4 mm nozzle diameter in the Creality Ender 3 printer for PLA printing. These values are considered appropriate for FDM with PLA, depending on the desired print resolution and application requirements [reference_112.pdf, reference_145.pdf].",

      "assistant_response": "The appropriate nozzle diameter for 3D printing using fused deposition modeling (FDM) with polylactic acid (PLA) mixed with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) is 0.4 mm. In the referenced study, a commercially available 3D printer (ENDER-3S, Shenzhen Creality3D Technology Co. Ltd., China) was used with an interchangeable nozzle, for which a 0.4 mm diameter was chosen to print PLA/HPMC composite samples [reference_55.pdf].",

According to the referenced document, materials containing MCC were processed up to 230°C, but the actual 3D printing was performed at 200°C to avoid degradation of the MCC component [reference_121.pdf].",
