      "assistant_response": "The retrieved documents do not specify an exact recommended nozzle diameter for 3D printing with PLA mixed with wood particles. However, one document mentions that a 0.4 mm nozzle was used for printing test samples with wood-PLA filaments on a Zortrax M200 3D printer (reference_115.pdf, page 136). This suggests that a 0.4 mm nozzle is suitable for such material blends, at least in the context of the referenced study.\n\nReference: reference_115.pdf, page 136.",
