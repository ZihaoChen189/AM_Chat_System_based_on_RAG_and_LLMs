The same process was used to print PLA and PLA-SCF specimens with standard Prusa i3 MK3S 3D printer.\"*  \n**Source**: `reference_124.pdf`, page 3 (FDM Process Parameters folder).  \n\nNo other nozzle diameters (e.g., 0.2 mm or 0.4 mm referenced in other documents for pure PLA) are mentioned for SCF-reinforced PLA in the context of this document. The 1.5 mm diameter was used to accommodate the carbon fiber reinforcement while avoiding clogging.",

      "user_message": "What is the appropriate nozzle temperature for 3D printing using fused deposition modeling with polylactic acid (PLA) mixed with carbon nanotube (CNT)?",
      "assistant_response": "Based on the retrieved documents, the appropriate nozzle temperature range for 3D printing PLA mixed with **carbon nanotubes (CNTs)** is **177–185°C**. This temperature range was specifically tested for PLA/MWCNTs (multi-wall carbon nanotubes) nanocomposites with 0.5% and 1% CNT weight content. The extrusion at these temperatures resulted in successful 3D printing using FFF technology.  \n\n> *\"The extrusion temperatures used in tests were between 177 and 185ºC... [for] a PLA/MWCNTs nanocomposite... [with] promising result for the application... into 3D printing.\"*  \n**Source**: `reference_114.pdf`, page 875 (FDM Process Parameters folder).  \n\nThis range is notably lower than typical pure PLA printing temperatures (e.g., 190–230°C, as noted in `reference_188.pdf`), likely due to the enhanced thermal properties imparted by CNTs. No higher temperatures were tested or recommended for PLA/CNT composites in the retrieved context.",
