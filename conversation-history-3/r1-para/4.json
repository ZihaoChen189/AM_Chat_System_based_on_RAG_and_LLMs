      "assistant_response": "Based on the retrieved documents, the appropriate nozzle temperature range for 3D printing PLA-CF (carbon fiber-reinforced polylactic acid) composites using FDM is **230°C**. This temperature is experimentally determined to maximize tensile properties:\n\n1.  **Optimal temperature**:  \n    Tests of PLA-CF samples showed that **230°C** yielded the highest tensile strength and Young's modulus.  \n    > *\"Maximum tensile properties are attained for a nozzle temperature of 230°C for both PLA and PLA-CF\"*  \n    **Source:** `reference_181.pdf`, page 1 (Abstract).\n\n2.  **Crystallinity correlation**:  \n    At 230°C, PLA-CF exhibits a spike in crystallinity (Table 2), aligning with enhanced mechanical performance. Higher temperatures (e.g., 240–250°C) reduce crystallinity and properties.  \n    **Source:** `reference_181.pdf**, page 7 (Table 2 and associated text).\n\n3.  **Degradation limit**:  \n    For pure PLA, exceeding 240°C causes polymer degradation. PLA-CF can tolerate 230°C due to reinforced thermal stability but should not exceed 240°C.  \n    **Source:** `reference_188.pdf**, page 784 (Section 3.1).\n\n**Recommendation**: Use **230°C** for optimal mechanical properties in PLA-CF printing.",
