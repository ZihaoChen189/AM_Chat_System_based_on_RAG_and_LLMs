      "user_message": "How does nozzle diameter affect fused deposition modelling (FDM)-printed polylactic acid (PLA) parts?",
      "assistant_response": "Based on the retrieved documents, nozzle diameter significantly affects FDM-printed PLA parts in the following ways:\n\n1.  **Pore Size & Porosity**:  \n    Higher nozzle diameters increase pore size in rectilinear infill patterns. This occurs because a larger nozzle requires a greater distance between filaments to achieve the same infill percentage, resulting in larger pores ([reference_112.pdf, page 289](file:///Users/robert/Desktop/project/documents/reference_112.pdf)).\n\n2.  **Mechanical Properties**:  \n    Nozzle diameter is one of the most influential parameters affecting tensile strength. Smaller nozzles generally produce parts with higher tensile strength due to finer deposition and denser structures ([reference_187.pdf, page 3](file:///Users/robert/Desktop/project/documents/reference_187.pdf)).\n\n3.  **Surface Roughness**:  \n    Nozzle diameter directly impacts surface roughness. Larger nozzles typically result in coarser surface finishes, while smaller nozzles can achieve finer details and smoother surfaces ([reference_187.pdf, page 3](file:///Users/robert/Desktop/project/documents/reference_187.pdf)).\n\n4.  **Printing Time**:  \n    Larger nozzle diameters (combined with increased layer thickness) can reduce printing time for the same part volume, as they deposit more material per pass ([reference_187.pdf, page 3](file:///Users/robert/Desktop/project/documents/reference_187.pdf)).\n\n**Experimental Context**: Studies used nozzle diameters ranging from **0.2 mm to 0.8 mm**, with PLA printed at **205°C**. Specific comparisons (e.g., 0.2 mm vs. 0.4 mm) confirm these effects across infill densities (20%–80%) ([reference_112.pdf, page 288](file:///Users/robert/Desktop/project/documents/reference_112.pdf); [reference_187.pdf, page 3](file:///Users/robert/Desktop/project/documents/reference_187.pdf)).",

      "user_message": "How does the printing speed during fused deposition modelling (FDM) affect the quality of polylactic acid (PLA) products?",
      "assistant_response": "Based on the retrieved documents, printing speed significantly affects the quality of FDM-printed PLA products, primarily in terms of **mechanical strength** and **printing time**:\n\n1.  **Mechanical Strength Reduction**:\n    Increasing printing speed reduces the tensile strength of PLA parts. Testing shows that strength remains relatively stable between **50-80 mm/s**, but decreases sharply at speeds **above 80 mm/s** ([reference_130.pdf, page 1](file:///Users/robert/Desktop/project/documents/reference_130.pdf)).\n\n2.  **Printing Time Efficiency**:\n    Higher speeds reduce printing time substantially. For example, a sample printed at **100 mm/s** completes significantly faster than one printed at **20 mm/s**, though at the cost of reduced strength ([reference_130.pdf, page 1](file:///Users/robert/Desktop/project/documents/reference_130.pdf)).\n\n3.  **Quality Trade-off**:\n    The optimal speed range for balancing strength and efficiency is **50-80 mm/s** for PLA. Exceeding 80 mm/s sacrifices mechanical integrity for speed ([reference_130.pdf, page 1](file:///Users/robert/Desktop/project/documents/reference_130.pdf)).\n\n*Note: The reviewed documents did not discuss effects on surface roughness, dimensional accuracy, or warping in relation to speed.*",

      "user_message": "How does the printing direction in fused deposition modelling (FDM) influence the properties of polylactic acid (PLA) products?",
      "assistant_response": "Based on the retrieved documents, **printing direction/orientation** significantly influences the mechanical properties of FDM-printed PLA parts, particularly **tensile strength** and **stiffness**. The key findings are:\n\n1.  **Optimal Orientation for PLA**:  \n    The **Y-axis orientation** (where layers are deposited perpendicular to the tensile load direction) yields the **highest mechanical properties** in PLA parts, including Young's modulus, yield strength, and ultimate tensile strength ([reference_141.pdf, page 35](file:///Users/robert/Desktop/project/documents/reference_141.pdf)).  \n\n2.  **Contrast with ABS**:  \n    Unlike PLA, **ABS** achieves optimal mechanical properties when printed in the **X-axis orientation**. This highlights material-specific anisotropy in FDM processes ([reference_141.pdf, page 35](file:///Users/robert/Desktop/project/documents/reference_141.pdf)).  \n\n3.  **Underlying Cause**:  \n    The anisotropy arises from **layer adhesion quality** and **interlayer bonding**. In the Y-axis orientation, tensile forces act parallel to the layer bonds, reducing delamination risks and maximizing strength ([reference_141.pdf, page 35](file:///Users/robert/Desktop/project/documents/reference_141.pdf)).  \n\n*Note: The reviewed documents did not address effects on surface quality, dimensional accuracy, or thermal properties related to printing direction.*",
