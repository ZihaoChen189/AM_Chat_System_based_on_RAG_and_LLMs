      "user_message": "How does the adjustment of layer height in fused deposition modelling (FDM) affect the quality of printed polylactic acid (PLA) parts?",
      "assistant_response": "Based on the retrieved document content:\n\n1. **Surface Roughness**: Increasing layer height in FDM printing of PLA results in higher surface roughness. Specifically:\n   - The smallest surface roughness occurs at a layer height of **0.05 mm**.\n   - The highest surface roughness occurs at a layer height of **0.25 mm**.\n\n2. **Printing Time**: Printing time is inversely proportional to layer height. Higher layer heights reduce printing time, while lower layer heights increase it.\n\nThis relationship is explicitly stated in the study:  \n*\"The test results show that, the greater of layer height has the rougher of the surface. In addition, the printing time is inversely proportional to surface roughness.\"*  \n\n**Source**: `reference_145.pdf`, page 2.",
